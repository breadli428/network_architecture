# network_architecture_and_communication

This is a collection of codes I wrote to learn the construction of server-client communication via TCP/IP, as a preparation of my bachelor thesis, where I set up a remote battery management system with potential application on e-vehicles.

The battery health states (e.g. voltage, temperature) were encoded and transmitted to a server by local electrical control unit (LECU) and were thereafter composed into a user-friendly interface. Users can log into the service from any mobile device to check the battery health states and impose actions to control the battery system remotely.

The included technical practices and tools are
- LabVIEW
- TCP/IP
- CAN
- HTML5
